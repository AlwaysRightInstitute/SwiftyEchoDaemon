SwiftyEchoDaemon
================

The **bezt** Echo daemon ever written in Swift - SPM version.

This is a demo on how to use the
[SwiftSockets Swift Package Manager version](https://github.com/AlwaysRightInstitute/SwiftSockets/tree/feature/linux)
on Linux or OSX.

Great echo server. Compile it via `make`, run it via `make run`, then
connect to it in the Terminal.app via ```nc localhost 1337```.
